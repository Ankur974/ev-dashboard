# MapUp – Electric Vehicle Analytics Dashboard

This project is a frontend analytics dashboard built to analyze and visualize
Electric Vehicle (EV) population data. The dashboard presents key insights
using charts and summary metrics to help understand EV adoption trends,
manufacturer dominance, and vehicle type distribution.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Electric Vehicle adoption has increased significantly over recent years
- Tesla is the leading manufacturer by number of registered EVs
- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are more common than Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs)
- Average electric range has improved over time

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js
- PapaParse (for CSV parsing)

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dashboard uses a reduced version of the Electric Vehicle Population dataset
provided in the assessment repository. The data is processed directly on the
frontend without a backend due to its manageable size.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The CSV file is parsed in the browser using PapaParse
- Data is aggregated using JavaScript
- Charts are rendered using Chart.js
- The project is deployed as a static site on Vercel

---

## ▶️ Run Locally
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser  

(No backend or build setup required)

---

## 📌 Notes
- This is a frontend-only implementation
- For larger datasets, a backend with pre-aggregated APIs would be recommended
